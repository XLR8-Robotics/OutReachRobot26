Hello! I need your help to implement an automatic turret aiming system for my FTC robot. My robot uses a Turret subsystem, a Limelight for vision, and the pedropathing library for odometry.Here is a clear, step-by-step plan. Please follow it exactly, paying close attention to the specified class and method names.Important Note on Libraries: My project uses two different motion libraries: com.acmerobotics.roadrunner and com.pedropathing. These libraries have their own Pose2d classes. It is critical that you use the com.pedropathing.helpers.Pose2d for all new code related to odometry and field positions to avoid type conflicts.Phase 1: Create New FilesStep 1: Create FieldConstants.java Create a new file named FieldConstants.java in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package. This class will hold a static final Map<Integer, com.pedropathing.helpers.Pose2d> containing the field positions of the AprilTags. Use the official field coordinates and make sure the Pose2d is from the com.pedropathing.helpers package.Step 2: Create AimingController.java Create a new file named AimingController.java in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package. This class will be the "brain" for the aiming logic. It should have:•A constructor that takes in the Turret, Limelight, and Follower objects.•A setTargetAprilTagId(int id) method.•An update() method that performs the following logic:i.Gets the robot's current Pose2d from the Follower.ii.Gets the target AprilTag's Pose2d from FieldConstants.iii.Calculates the required absolute field angle from the robot to the target.iv.Calls a new method on the Turret subsystem (setTargetFieldAngle()) to command the turret to this angle.v.Updates the Limelight and checks if the target tag is visible.vi.If the tag is visible, it calculates the robot's pose based on the vision target (getVisionBasedRobotPose()) and corrects the Follower's odometry (follower.setPose()).vii.Calls the turret.update() method, passing in the robot's current heading in degrees.Phase 2: Modify Existing SubsystemsStep 3: Propose Modifications for Turret.java Modify my existing Turret.java class. Do not break the existing manual control. The changes must include:•An enum TurretState { AIMING, MANUAL }.•A method setState(TurretState newState) that correctly switches the motor between RUN_USING_ENCODER (for MANUAL) and RUN_TO_POSITION (for AIMING).•A method setTargetFieldAngle(double angle) to store the desired absolute field angle.•A public update(double currentRobotHeading) method. This method will contain the core PID logic for aiming. When in the AIMING state, it should:i.Calculate the robot-relative target angle by subtracting the currentRobotHeading from the stored target field angle.ii.Convert this angle to motor encoder ticks.iii.Use the turretMotor.setTargetPosition() and turretMotor.setPower() methods to drive the motor to the calculated position.•Modify the existing update(Gamepad gamepad) method to be manualUpdate(Gamepad gamepad) and ensure it only provides power to the motor if the turret is in the MANUAL state.Step 4: Propose Modifications for Limelight.java Add the following two public methods to my Limelight.java class:•getDistanceToTarget(): Calculates the distance to the AprilTag in inches using the ty value and trigonometry.•getVisionBasedRobotPose(com.pedropathing.helpers.Pose2d knownTagPose): This method calculates the robot's field Pose2d by working backward from the known tag's pose and the camera's tx and distance measurements. It must return a com.pedropathing.helpers.Pose2d.Phase 3: Create the TeleOpStep 5: Create a New AimingTeleOp.java Create a new LinearOpMode named AimingTeleOp.java in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package. This OpMode should:1.Instantiate the Follower, Turret, Limelight, and the new AimingController.2.In the main loop, update the Follower odometry.3.Use Gamepad 1 for standard drivetrain control, calling the follower.setDrivePowers() method.4.Implement a button on Gamepad 2 to toggle an aimingMode boolean variable.5.When aimingMode is true, call the aimingController.update() method.6.When aimingMode is false, call the turret.manualUpdate(gamepad2) method.7.Include telemetry to display the current mode, robot pose, and turret angle.After proposing all the code, please run a build to verify there are no compilation errors before you finish.
